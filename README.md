A currency converter built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring real-time exchange rates, reusable components, and custom hooks.

This project is a responsive currency converter application built using React that enables users to convert amounts between multiple international currencies in real time. The application fetches up-to-date exchange rates from a public currency API and dynamically updates conversion values based on user input.

The project follows a component-based architecture, making the code modular and easy to maintain. A custom React hook is used to handle API calls and manage exchange-rate data efficiently, separating business logic from the UI layer. Reusable components such as input fields and currency selectors improve scalability and readability.
The application also demonstrates best practices in React development, including state management with hooks, conditional rendering, and asynchronous data fetching.
